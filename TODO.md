### TODO:
##### Scouting:
- Make an easier way to make game-specific UI elements
##### Data Analysis:
- Add analysis for the rest of the data types besides Tally
- Add a "scout note" system for scouters to contribute to the scouting report?
- Make data that has been marked for rescouting not processed in either by team or by type analysis.
##### Functionality:
- Rewrite FTP transfer to be over HTTP requests
- - Potentially using a python server or some other pre-existing file transfer over HTTP
- Delete file menu
- Make "Sync meta files" option only block uploading fields specifically.
##### UI:
- Update docs and README.md with new features
- Improve file status indicator for scouting
- - The autosave timeout can be significantly reduced, so the save indicator is not a necessity
- - A new system for the rescout indicator should be used.
- Improve UI elements for scouting data by team
- Field button in settings overlaps with other elements in some devices
