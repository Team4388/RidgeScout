**Note**: The F-Droid version of this app is not currently up to date with the GitHub release

[**Read the wiki**](https://github.com/Team4388/ScoutingApp2025/wiki)

#### Here is an overview of the main features currently included in the app:
- This project is written for Android! No need for some kind of janky laptop charging setup.
- Similar to ScoutingPASS, there are many diffrent types of fields that can be used to collect data.
- The app is designed to handle updates to the fields on the fly, without loosing any data!
- Unlike other scouting solutions, scouters can disable any field they did not measure, and disabled fields will not be included in any calculations.
- Dynamic displays based off of the diffrent fields.
- Data transfer including 2D codes, Bluetooth, and File Bundle.
- Exporting using CSV.
- Deployment on F-Droid

#### Things that are yet to be implemented:
- A page that lets users cross-compare scouting data between teams. (Compare)
- A page that lets scouters more easily make reports to the drive team before a match starts (Report)
- More types of fields
- Data cloud sync using an FTP server
#### Things that may or may not be implemented:
- Practice mode
- Statbotics intgration
- Scout error estimation using OPR-like calculation
- - Would most likely require Statbotics
